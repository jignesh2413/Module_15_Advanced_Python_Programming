1) What is File function in python? What is keywords to create and write file.

-> Python has a built-in open() function to open a file. 
   This function returns a file object, also called a handle, as it is used to read or 
   modify the file accordingly. We can specify the mode while opening a file.

2) Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

-> An Exception is an error that happens during the execution of a program. 
   Whenever there is an error, Python 
   generates an exception that could be handled. 
   It basically prevents the program from getting crashed.

3) How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some
   built-in exception classes:

-> more than zero
        - there has to be atleast one except statements

4) When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?

-> when no exception occurs

5) Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception?

-> each type of exception can be specify directly.

6) When is the finally block executed?

-> The finally block always executes when the try block exits

7) What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?

-> it simply evaluates to false and does not raise any exception

8) How Do You Handle Exceptions With Try/Except/Finally In Python?
   Explain with coding snippets.

-> # import module sys to get the type of exception
import sys

randomList = ['a', 0, 2]

for entry in randomList:
    try:
        print("The entry is", entry)
        r = 1/int(entry)
        break
    except:
        print("Oops!", sys.exc_info()[0], "occurred.")
        print("Next entry.")
        print()
print("The reciprocal of", entry, "is", r)

9) What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java

-> OOP Concepts
    - OOPS : object oriented programming.
	- class
	- object
	- encapsulization
	- inheritance
	- data abstraction.
	- polymorphism

10) How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A
    Python Class

-> name and age: class Person: def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name.

11) Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is
    A Constructor In Python?

-> Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class

        example :
                Class BaseClass:
                    {Body}
                Class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
                    {Body}

12) what is instantiation in terms of oop terminology?

-> In the OOP language C#, instantiation describes the processes of creating 
   a new object for a class using a new keyword.

13) What is used to check whether an object  
    is an instance of class A?

-> Using isinstance() function, we can test whether an object/variable is an instance of the 
   specified type or class such as int or list. 

14) What relationship is appropriate for Course and Faculty?

->
